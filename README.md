## Hi there 👋

I’m Martins, a first-year Applied Computer Science student at Hogeschool PXL based in Belgium.

I love learning, experimenting, and building anything that helps me grow as a developer.

Whenever I get an idea, I try to turn it into a project — big or small — just to see how far I can push myself.

My tech stack is pretty varied and constantly evolving, but I enjoy working with anything that challenges me or teaches me something new.

I’m currently working on a personal project to sharpen my skills and explore new technologies.

If you ever want to reach out, you can email me at martinsoplayz@gmail.com

• I’m passionate about tech and always improving myself

• I like building things from scratch and learning by doing

• Hobbies : gym,sports,building things
